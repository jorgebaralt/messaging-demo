Expo is the easiest way to start building a new React Native application. It allows you to start a project without installing or configuring any tools to build native code - no Xcode or Android Studio installation required (see Caveats).

Assuming that you have Node 8+ installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
